What Is It ?
============

Author: Stephen Thompson

This is a browser based game, challenging the player to identify drawings 
taken from Google's `Quickdraw`_ data set. Each drawing is drawn by a human and 
correctly identified by Google's AI.

Once you've warmed up on the full image, we introduce an image mask to make it harder. 
We're trying to test the likely effects of image mosaicking, which is an important 
area of research in minimally invasive surgery.
