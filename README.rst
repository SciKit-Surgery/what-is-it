This is a browser based game, challenging the player to identify drawings 
taken from Google's `Quickdraw`_ data set. Each drawing is drawn by a human and 
correctly identified by Google's AI.

Once you've warmed up on the full image, we introduce an image mask based on a 
medical ultrasound probe to make it harder. 
The intention is to examine the factors that make identification using 
partial visibility and noise more difficult. The presence of speckle type noise is 
often cited as a difficulty in using ultrasound imaging.
